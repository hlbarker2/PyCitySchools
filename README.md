# PyCitySchools

This project analyzed a school district's standardized test results using Python Pandas:

* As a whole, charter schools out-perform district schools across all metrics, including average reading and math scores, reading and math pass rates, and overall pass rates. The top five performing schools are charter schools, while the bottom five performing schools are district schools.
* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools (less than 2000 students) out-perform larger schools (greater than 2000 students) across all metrics.
* Schools that spend less money per student (615 dollars or below) tend to out-perform schools that spend more money per student (615 dollars or greater).
* At first glance, there does not appear to be a significant difference in math and reading test scores across the grade levels in both charter and district schools.
